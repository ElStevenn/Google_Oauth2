## OVERVIEW

 - A short Flask application to make the oauth 2.0 Authentication Server.
   
![Oauth2 overview](https://paus-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/server_storage/authorization-code.png)
   
Once the client has the token, all you need to do it's just get the client's token, decode the code (with the auth server) and get the data (the data information will vary depending of the scopes)


## Q&A
  - All you need to do it's just implement the code and the token, (i'll say you how to get the token, you need to make another steep before)
  - It's secure? Yes
  - Once I understood the working of OAuth2, do I need to store the token somewhere? Yes, in the client's application (web, mobile, desktop, whatever) stoage, plain as simple
